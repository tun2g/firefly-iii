# It's not you, it's me

Sometimes bugs reported to Firefly III are configuration and system problems on the user's side.

If you run into any of the following problems, there's a good chance it's not a Firefly III issue, but a configuration
issue.

- ⚠️ Firefly III can't connect to the database when starting or the password is wrong, even though you're sure it's
  correct.
- ⚠️ Errors about a missing `APP_KEY` or other encryption/hash problems
- ⚠️ You can't login due to `419` errors (page expired)
- ⚠️ Any `500` error when starting Firefly III
- ⚠️ Any white page when starting Firefly III
- ⚠️ Time-out when starting Firefly III for the first time
- ⚠️ Firefly III does not work behind your reverse proxy
- ⚠️ You can't connect to the Data Importer due to 404's or authentication issues.
